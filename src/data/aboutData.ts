      "Gleen Wilmore is an independent web designer based in Edinburgh, working with individuals, startups, and established businesses across Scotland and the UK.",
      "My work sits at the intersection of design and implementation. I design and build bespoke websites with a strong emphasis on clarity, performance, and long-term usability, taking care to ensure each project is considered both visually and technically. Rather than following a fixed stack, I select tools and frameworks according to the needs of the work, with experience across WordPress and modern front-end frameworks.",
      "I lead projects end-to-end, from early design exploration through to delivery. I work closely with clients throughout the process and, where appropriate, collaborate with a small network of trusted developers to maintain a high technical standard.",
      "My practice is grounded in restraint and attention to detail — favouring clean design, accessible interfaces, and systems that are straightforward to maintain. The focus is on producing work that feels deliberate, durable, and professional, and that continues to serve its purpose beyond launch.",
      "Outside of client work, I enjoy lifting weights and reading classic literature"
