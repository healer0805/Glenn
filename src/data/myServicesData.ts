Each project has a different goal, but the process always feels the same to me: create something that looks great and actually works. From clean, simple layouts to bold, expressive designs, I focus on shaping a site to fit the client, not the other way around. Whether it's an online store or a portfolio, I care about building something that feels right and gets maximum results.",

        "For this project, I designed a full website for LEVEL8, a high-end travel case brand known for their premium luggage and travel accessories. The goal was to create a sleek, modern shopping experience that matched the luxury and precision of their products.",
        "I built the entire site layout and UI in Figma, focusing on clean structure, elegant typography, and strong visual hierarchy to keep things both high-end and approachable. Each section was carefully planned to balance storytelling with product visibility, leading customers naturally from brand messaging to conversion points.",
        "Once the static designs were in place, I worked closely with ZAM's motion designer Tigran Azatyan to add that final layer of polish. They introduced subtle animations and motion transitions throughout the site to make the user experience feel more dynamic and refined.",
        "From concept to completion, this site was about blending modern design with luxury product storytelling to help LEVEL8 stand out in the competitive travel space."

        "For the Jon Campbell Team, I led a full rebrand to help position them as a top-tier force in the real estate market. Their old identity felt scattered and didn't reflect the scale of their business, so I created a unified, premium brand system from the ground up.",
        "Using Figma, I built a full visual identity that included a bold new logo, geometric brand mark, typography, color palette, and supporting pattern work. Everything was designed to feel modern, trustworthy, and instantly recognizable. I also designed a custom website focused on user experience and lead generation.",
        "The site integrated a fast, SEO-friendly IDX property search and featured a clean, responsive layout that made navigation smooth across all devices. Every page was planned to feel simple and professional while driving conversions. Beyond digital, I carried the brand through print materials, signage, and motion assets. I created an animated logo and branded video assets to help build a consistent presence across social media and marketing content.",
        "To finish the project, I delivered a full asset library and CMS training, making it easy for the team to manage content while keeping the brand locked in. The end result was a major success. Lead costs dropped from $600 to $50, website traffic grew by over 40 percent in the first 90 days, and search rankings improved significantly in just a few months."
