    description: "I love the process of building a brand. For me, every logo is like solving a quiet puzzle, shaping lines and space until it tells a story without needing to explain itself. Whether it's a simple hand-drawn mark or something more polished and geometric, I focus on creating something that feels honest and lasting. Along with the logo, I build full identity systems with brand guides, patterns, and design elements ready for both print and digital. It's about giving your brand a voice, and I'd be excited to help you find it.",

It was a project full of challenges, from balancing corporate expectations with creative freedom to building a brand that felt modern while respecting its history. I created complex logos, pattern systems, business cards, social assets, a custom website, and branded swag, ensuring every detail worked together cohesively. Working through the trials of a large-scale rebrand taught me the value of flexibility and precision, and seeing the final brand come to life was one of the most rewarding moments of my career."

One of my favorite collaborations has been with author Rebecca Sharp, who asked me to craft a brand identity as memorable as her favorite luxury labels. I built a system of elegant patterns, rich colors, and timeless visuals designed to evoke the feeling of cutting pages from a beloved book to create a personal scrapbook. Right now, I'm working on a dynamic, visually stunning website for her. More to come soon!"
